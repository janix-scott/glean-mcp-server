# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Glean MCP Server

## Objective
Fork and enhance the existing Glean MCP server to create a version that:
- Adds HTTP transport support alongside the existing stdio transport
- Implements OAuth-based authentication and user context switching
- Securely stores and manages Glean API tokens
- Maps authenticated users to their Glean identities
- Provides usage analytics and monitoring
- Maintains backward compatibility with the original implementation

## Architecture Overview

### Enhanced MCP Server
- Provides dual transport support (HTTP and stdio) for client communication
- Authenticates users through corporate SSO
- Maps authenticated users to their Glean identities
- Maintains a single process with user context switching
- Forwards requests to Glean API with appropriate user context
- Returns responses back to clients over the selected transport

## Key Components

### 1. Transport Layer
- Implement HTTP server supporting the MCP protocol
- Maintain compatibility with the existing stdio transport
- Support streaming responses via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Add configuration options for transport selection

### 2. Authentication Layer
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication
- Manage user sessions and token refreshes
- Verify user identities and map to Glean identities
- Store authentication state securely

### 3. User Context Management
- Implement user context switching mechanism
- Store user-specific settings and preferences
- Manage Glean identity mappings
- Handle user privileges and access control

### 4. Request Handling
- Process incoming requests from both transport types
- Apply user context to each request
- Forward requests to Glean API with appropriate authentication
- Return responses through the appropriate transport

### 5. Analytics & Monitoring
- Track usage patterns by user
- Monitor request volumes and performance
- Generate usage reports by team or department
- Provide health check endpoints

## Implementation Details

* **Language**: TypeScript (maintaining consistency with original codebase)
* **HTTP Framework**: Express.js for handling HTTP requests
* **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 implementation with multiple provider support
* **Session Management**: Secure session handling with encryption
* **Logging**: Structured logging with context awareness
* **Environment Variables**:
   * `GLEAN_API_TOKEN`: Centrally managed Glean API token
   * `GLEAN_SUBDOMAIN`: Glean subdomain
   * `GLEAN_TRANSPORT`: Transport selection (http, stdio, or both)
   * `GLEAN_HTTP_PORT`: Port for HTTP server (if enabled)
   * `GLEAN_AUTH_ENABLED`: Toggle for authentication requirement
   * `SSO_CLIENT_ID`: SSO client ID
   * `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET`: SSO client secret
   * `SSO_CALLBACK_URL`: SSO callback URL

## Security Considerations
- Store API tokens securely using environment variables
- Implement HTTPS for all HTTP communication
- Validate and sanitize all incoming requests
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure user context data in memory

## Transport Considerations
- Implement MCP over HTTP according to specification
- Support both POST and GET methods for HTTP
- Maintain backward compatibility with stdio transport
- Handle HTTP request timeouts appropriately
- Support streaming responses over HTTP SSE

## User Context Management
- Implement efficient context switching with minimal overhead
- Ensure isolation between user contexts
- Handle authentication failures gracefully
- Provide admin capabilities for user management

## Deployment
* **Containerization**: Docker for containerizing the application
* **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing deployment
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
* **Distribution**: NPM package for easy installation

## Future Enhancements
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Integrate with additional identity providers
- Provide a web dashboard for monitoring and analytics
- Support WebSocket for bidirectional communication

This PRD outlines the necessary components for developing an enhanced version of the Glean MCP server with HTTP transport, authentication, and user context management capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility with the original implementation.
