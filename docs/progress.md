# Project Progress Report

## Completed Items

### Phase 1: Fork & Initial HTTP Implementation
1. ✅ HTTP Server Implementation
   - Implemented FastAPI-based HTTP server
   - Added HTTP transport adapter for MCP protocol
   - Implemented proper HTTP status codes and error handling
   - Added session management

2. ✅ Transport Configuration
   - Implemented configuration via environment variables
   - Maintained backward compatibility with stdio transport
   - Added basic logging

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Context
1. ✅ OAuth Implementation
   - Created OAuth authentication module
   - Implemented token validation
   - Added mock OAuth provider for testing
   - Added token caching mechanism

2. ✅ User Context Management
   - Created user context model
   - Implemented user context in session management
   - Added user context to MCP messages

## In Progress

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Context (Continued)
1. 🔄 OAuth Flow Enhancement
   - Need to implement authorization code flow
   - Need to add refresh token support
   - Need to support multiple identity providers

2. 🔄 Session Management
   - Basic implementation complete
   - Need to add session persistence
   - Need to implement session timeout and renewal

### Phase 3: Analytics & Monitoring
1. 🔄 Usage Analytics
   - Not started
   - Need to implement request tracking
   - Need to add performance metrics
   - Need to create analytics storage

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 3: Analytics & Monitoring (Continued)
1. ⏳ Monitoring System
   - Need to enhance health check endpoints
   - Need to implement performance monitoring
   - Need to create alerting mechanisms

2. ⏳ Admin Dashboard API
   - Need to design API for admin operations
   - Need to implement user management endpoints
   - Need to create reporting endpoints

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
1. 🔄 Comprehensive Testing
   - Basic unit tests implemented
   - Need more integration tests
   - Need load testing
   - Need security assessment

2. ⏳ Performance Optimization
   - Need to identify bottlenecks
   - Need to implement caching
   - Need to optimize resource usage

3. ⏳ Documentation
   - Need API documentation
   - Need deployment guides
   - Need user manuals

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **High Priority**
   - Fix current 404 errors in HTTP server
   - Complete OAuth flow implementation
   - Add integration tests for HTTP server with authentication
   - Implement session persistence

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Add refresh token support
   - Implement authorization code flow
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Create basic admin endpoints

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Implement analytics
   - Create documentation
   - Add load testing
   - Optimize performance

## Known Issues

1. 🐛 HTTP server returning 404 for MCP requests
   - Need to investigate routing configuration
   - May be related to authentication integration

2. 🔄 Authentication flow incomplete
   - Only token validation implemented
   - Need full OAuth flow
   - Need refresh token support

## Testing Coverage

1. ✅ Authentication Module
   - Unit tests for token validation
   - Mock OAuth provider
   - Token caching tests

2. 🔄 HTTP Server
   - Basic endpoint tests
   - Need more integration tests
   - Need load tests

3. ✅ Process Transport
   - Unit tests implemented
   - Integration tests implemented

## Notes

- The basic infrastructure is in place but needs refinement
- Authentication is partially implemented but needs completion
- Testing framework is solid but needs more coverage
- Need to focus on fixing current issues before adding new features
